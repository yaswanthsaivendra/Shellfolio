# After Death

An app where a user puts in some data which he might to pass on to others after his/her death.

How do we know the user died??

We have few ways which we can give the user to configure

1. Timeout Death 
    User selects a time in future. he has to update that time before the time expires. If it does, we consider he is dead and pass on the data.
2. Condition check Death
   A way to check user last acivity on mail, phone or some other way around. Inactive == Dead.
