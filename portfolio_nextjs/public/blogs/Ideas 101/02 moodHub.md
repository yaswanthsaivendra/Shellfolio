# Mood HUB

## Introduction:

Mood HUB is a new way for people in relationships to communicate better. It was created because relationships can face problems when talking through messages, especially when dealing with distance or the need for privacy.

 <b>Target audience</b> : people in relationship 

## The Backstory:
    The idea for Mood HUB came from personal experiences, like a past relationship that encountered significant challenges, primarly due to miscommunication via chat. I realized many people face similar hurdles in maintaing a meaningful connection with their partners, whether due to distance or privary concerns. 


## Understanding the Two Worlds:

Mood HUB recognizes two types of users:

1. **Open Communicators:**
   People who can freely talk through calls.

2. **Restricted Communicators:**
   Individuals who, due to privacy concerns or the presence of others in their surroundings, can only communicate through messages and have the constant worry of being caught.


## Research Insight

    Research concludes 

        "not to talk via chat" as one of the best relationship advice.

    chat can abstract many things your tone, what you actually want to express or your current mood.

    For example, take the sentence "fuck u"

    imagine a person texting "fuck u" in these 3 moods : angry, horny , flirty or dramatic.

    It completely misguides the other person based on their mood and may sometimes get even worse.

    Traditional chat applications often miss the emotions behind the words

    The main root for the problems which are neglected in any normal chat applications and are neccessary for people in relationship are raised as concerns and found solutions and built into a one stop solution called "Mood HUB"
